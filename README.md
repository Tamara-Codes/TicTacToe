VERSION 1

I have made the skeleton of a Tic Tac Toe game, just HTML with some basic CSS. I used both flexbox and grid this time. I have written some functions in JS, just to get an outline.

VERSOIN 2

It's slowly coming together. I have added some JS to open up a form to enter player names, and save them for the game. Next step is to actually make the game playable!
