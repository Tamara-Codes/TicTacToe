VERSION 1

I have made the skeleton of a Tic Tac Toe game, just HTML with some basic CSS. I used both flexbox and grid this time. I have written some functions in JS, just to get an outline.

VERSION 2

It's slowly coming together. I have added some JS to open up a form to enter player names, and save them for the game. Next step is to actually make the game playable!

VERSION 3

It's finished! It took me a while, this was not easy at all. I learned about factory functions returning functions as objects and about variable scoping. I'm sure the code could be even further improved by removing the global gameController variable, but I'll leave that for later.
